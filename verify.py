Bible Data Verifier - Checks bible_data.json for completeness.

This script audits each translation inside bible_data.json and checks it
against the known canonical Bible structure (66 books, correct chapter/verse
counts). It produces a report showing any missing data.

Usage:
    python verify.py
    python verify.py --input bible_data.json
    python verify.py --version NIV       # Check a specific translation only
    python verify.py --summary           # Print summary only, no per-verse detail
